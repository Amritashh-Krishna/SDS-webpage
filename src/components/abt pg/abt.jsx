            Since its founding in 2019, we have united students from various
            disciplines behind our shared passion for all things data. Our
            mission is to foster a strong data science community on campus. Each
            semester, we focus on developing educational learning experiences
            like our technical workshops and decal courses to expand data
            science education on campus, hosting professional events for
            students to connect with industry leaders and grow their network,
            and conducting analytics consulting projects to help members gain
            experience and make an impact. Our program provides over a hundred
            students each semester with mentorship and data science skills
            through working in teams on a tangible group project. We aim to
            build an inclusive and accessible community where students of all
            levels and backgrounds can dive into the world of data science.

            <p>
              Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis,
              machine learning and their related methods" in order to
              "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs
              techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context
              of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information
              science.

              You are going to need more than technical knowledge to succeed as
              a data scientist. Build a Career in Data Science teaches you what
              school leaves out, from how to land your first job to the
              lifecycle of a data science project, and even how to become a
              manager.
